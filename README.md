A web application that features some of the dishes I made. The web app is hosted on AWS EC2. Check it out [here](http://nhanwebapp.hopto.org/)

This project is currently in development. All neccessary features are implemented. However, like and share button are not working. I want to incorperate google map API to show location of the restaurant and resize the menu bar when open the website on mobile devices.
